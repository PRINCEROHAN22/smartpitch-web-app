## 💡 What is SmartPitch UI?

SmartPitch UI is a **simple web-based pitch generator** for freelancers, solopreneurs, and indie builders who want to create cold messages fast — without using an API or external AI service.

This version is a UI upgrade of our original CLI tool: [SmartPitch CLI](https://github.com/PRINCEROHAN22/smartpitch-cli).

You can:
- ✅ Enter your name, target client name, and service type
- ✅ Instantly generate a pitch using pre-made templates
- ✅ Copy the pitch and customize it as needed

🌱 Inspiration

This was built to support early freelancers in crafting professional cold pitches, even with zero tech or copywriting skills.

It simulates a basic “AI-like” generation approach, using structured input and smart templates — a stepping stone before fully automated tools.

🔮 Future Upgrades (Planned)

 Add AI-based pitch generation via OpenAI API (optional)
